I have a passion for photography. In the past, I discovered an app called Leica Watermark that allowed me to add a watermark displaying the EXIF data of my photos. However, the app is no longer available.

Since I couldnâ€™t find a suitable alternative, I decided to create my own EXIF watermark generator. Because it runs entirely on the client side, no photos are stored on any server, and it works without an internet connection.

If you have any suggestions or encounter any bugs, feel free to create an issue or [reach out to me](mailto:rizahoemae@gmail.com).
